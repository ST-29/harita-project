                <h4>Why Parijat is most Popular among Lucky Flowers?</h4>
                <p>In Hindu mythology, the Parijat tree is believed to have originated from the churning of the cosmic
                    ocean during the Samudra Manthan.

                    It is said that Lord Krishna brought the tree to Earth as a gift for his wife, Satyabhama.

                    Today, the tree is considered a sacred symbol of love and devotion.

                    Grow a Parijat in your garden and behold the wonder of the Parijat tree, a marvel of nature that
                    will leave you breathless and awestruck.

                    Let its delicate flowers and rich mythology transport you to a world beyond our own, where magic and
                    wonder reign supreme.</p>
